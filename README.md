# Image-Processing
This project is based on Computer Vision where captures photos then analyzing them  through three stages "first: face detection to make sure there is person in picture, second: face  recognition to recognize a child who it takes care, third: emotion  recognition". Depending on results  of emotions recognition the robot behaves. For example, if the robot finds the child angry, it will deal with him by the ideal ways of child rearing (It will converse with him by inter active listening. According to the child answers, it'll decide for example: displaying a suitable video cartoon, playing  music â€¦.etc.). 
We used haar cascade algorithm for face detection, local binary pattern "LBP" algorithm to face recognition and fisher face algorithm for facial expressions 
The project's book  'in following link ' explains every thing in details
